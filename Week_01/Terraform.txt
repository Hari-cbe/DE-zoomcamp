TERRAFORM :

	-> infrastructure of code 
		-> make resources of code file 
	-> simplicity in keeping track of infra 
	-> easier collaboration 
	-> Reproducibility 
	-> Ensure resources are removed

HOW ->
	Local Machine ( Terraform ) <---Provider---> Cloud 

Providers -> Code to communicate between local to cloud 

Variables.tf -> declaring variable and using it in main.tf

Variable example :
variable "VariableName"{
description = ""
default = ""
}

unset <Credentials> -> remove the credentials file 

key terraform commands :

init -> get me the provider I need 
Plan -> what am I about to do ?
Apply -> Do what is in the tf files 
Destroy -> Remove everything defind in the tf files
terraform fmt -> format the code 

Service Account -> like normal account but never ment to be logged into ( * no loggin's )
	{ Access => Storage Admin, BigQuery Admin, Compute Admin }



What have Done in Tf :
- Created a Sevice Account in gcp 
- Exported the Google gloud crendentials to local machine 
- Created a main.tf file and add the service providers to it 
- Created a google gloud bucket and add the service
- Added a git ignore so the keys will not be pushed to the git.
- Created a variable file and mapped to the main.tf
